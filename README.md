# Mineral-Exploration-Environmental-Impact-Assessment
This project develops an AI-based mineral exploration and environmental impact assessment system using GIS and data analytics. The dashboard identifies high, medium, and low mineral potential zones while evaluating vegetation loss, land degradation, and pollution risk to support sustainable and controlled mining decisions
